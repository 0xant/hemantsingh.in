      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I work on building and advising practical digital systems for Indian MSMEs.
        My focus is not on tools or trends, but on decisions that improve reliability,
        clarity, and long-term sustainability under real-world constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work spans operations, SaaS strategy, automation, and security-aware IT
        thinking — always grounded in real execution.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Think</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Accuracy matters more than assumptions</li>
        <li>Security is a design input, not an afterthought</li>
        <li>Simple systems scale better than clever ones</li>
        <li>Every abstraction has a cost</li>
        <li>Operational clarity beats theoretical perfection</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I run and operate ventures across B2B operations, SaaS platforms, and
        consumer brands. This gives me direct exposure to supply chains,
        internal processes, customer behaviour, and system constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not interested in generic frameworks. I prefer approaches that survive
        real-world friction, regulatory constraints, and imperfect users.
      </p>
    <p>
        This has shaped a bias toward systems that remain understandable and operable
        even when conditions are imperfect.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What I Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Over-engineering without operational need</li>
        <li>Blind adoption of tools without understanding trade-offs</li>
        <li>Security compromises for short-term convenience</li>
        <li>Systems that only work in ideal conditions</li>
      </ul>
